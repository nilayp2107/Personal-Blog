        <h3>Morphology</h3>
        <p>
            <b>Definition: </b> Morphology is the subfield of linguistic that focuses on studying the internal structure of the words.
            <br /><b>Morphemes  </b> are the smallest meaningful units of language.
            <br />It helps 
            <ul>
                <li>decipher the rules governing word formation</li>
                <li>identify word families</li>
                <li>recognise the connections between related words</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h4>Morphemes: </h4>
        <p> They are the building blocks of the words. 
            <br />They can be considered as a distinct unit of meaning which cannot be further divided without losing meaning.
            <br />They can be the individual word or parts of the word. e.g. "unhappiness" with un-, happy, -ness. 
        </p>
            <h4>Types of Morphemes: </h4>
            <p>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Free Morphemes: </b> are words that can stand alone as meaningful units. <br /><b>Examples </b> dog, book, run, happy, cat, etc. </li>
                    <li><b>Bound Morphemes: </b>can't stand alone as independent words but are added to other morphemes to convey meaning. <br />Inlcudes prefixes, suffixes, infixes, circumfixes. <br /><b>Examples </b> -ed in "walked", -s in "cats", un- in "unhappiness" </li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <h4>Types of Bound Morphemes: </h4>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Prefixes:</b> added to the beginning of the root word
                    <br /><b>Examples: </b> un- in un-do, un-happy,etc
                    <br />re- in re-do, re-turn, etc.
                    <br />dis- in dis-like, dis-arm, etc   
                </li>
                <li><b>Suffixes:</b> added to the end of the root word
                    <br /><b>Examples: </b> -ing in runn-ing, swimm-ing,etc
                    <br />-er in teach-er, work-er, etc.
                    <br />-ed in walk-ed, jump-ed, etc   
                </li>
                <li><b>Infixes:</b> inserted inside a root word
                    <br /><b>Examples </b> from Tagalog, a Philippine language:
                    <br />gusto "like" to gu-stonggu-sto "really like"
                    <br />sulat "a writing" to s-inu-lat "that which was written"
                </li>
                <li><b>Circumfixes:</b> also called <b>dicontinuous affixes</b>, consists of two parts: one added to the beginning and the other to the end.
                    <br /><b>Examples </b> from German:
                    <br />mach 'make' to ge-mach-t 'made'
                </li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Inflectional v/s Derivational Morphemes: </h4>
            <p>
                <b>Inflectional morpheme</b> is used to convey <b>grammatical information</b> within a word, like number, tenses, possesion, mood, aspect, case, etc. 
                <br /><b>Examples </b> -s in "cats" for plural
                <br /> -ed in "walked" for past tenses
                <br /> -ing in "studying" for present participle
                <br /> -s' in "John's book" for possesive marker
                <br /> -en in "broken" for past participle 
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Derivational Morphemes </b> are used to create new words or change an existing word's core meaning or grammatical category.
                <br /><b>Examples </b> -er in "teacher" as agentive maker
                <br /> -ly in "quickly" as adverb maker
                <br /> -ness in "happiness" as noun maker
                <br /> Can be <b>class changing</b> or <b>class maintaining</b>
                <br />run to runn-er (class changing from verb to noun)
                <br />king to king-dom (class maintaining from noun to noun)
            </p>
            <h4>Allomorphy: </h4>
            <p>
                The lingusitic phenomenon where a single morpheme has multiple pronunciations or surface forms, called <b>allomorphs</b>. 
                <br />Allomorphs are variants forms of the same morphemes that occur in different linguistic contexts or environments. 
                <br /><b>Example: </b>-s has three allomorphs like for <br />cats it's <i>/s/</i>, <br />for dogs it's <i>/z/</i>, <br />and for houses it's <i>/iz/</i>.
            </p>
            <h4>Root, Base and Stem</h4>
            <p>
                <b>Root: </b> is the portion of the word that carries the principal portion of the meaning of the words in which it functions and is not further analyzable into meaningful elements, being morphologically simple. 
                <br /><b>Examples: </b> cat, bat, book, apple, big, fast, etc.
                <br /><b>Base: </b> is the portion of the word to which any derivational affix is added. 
                <br /><b>Examples: </b>kingdom, teacher, kindness, etc.
                <br /><b>Stem: </b> is the root or the roots of the word, together with any derivatinal affixes, to which inflectional affixes are added.
                <br /><b>Examples: </b>kingdoms, teachers, kindnesses, etc.
            </p>

        <h3>Syntax</h3>
        <p>
            Syntax is the branch of lingusitic that studies the rule governing the structure of sentences. 
        </p>
        <h4>Parts of the Speech</h4>
        <p>
            Parts of the speech are the categories into which words are classified based on their function in a sentence.
            <br /><b>Noun: </b>A word that represents a person, place, thing, or idea. 
            <br /><b>Pronoun: </b>A word that is used to replace or substitute a noun in a sentence. e.g. he, she, it, they, etc.
            <br /><b>Verb: </b>A word that describes an action, occurence or state of being. 
            <br /><b>Adjective: </b>A word that describes or modifies a noun or a pronoun. e.g. In "Beautiful garden", "beautiful" is an adjective.
            <br /><b>Adverb: </b>A word  that describes or modifies a verb, adjective or other adverb. e.g. "She sings beautifully", "beautifully" is an adverb.
            <br /><b>Preposition: </b>A word that desrcibes the relationship between a noun or a pronoun and other words in the sentences. e.g. in, on, under, over, etc.
            <br /><b>Conjunction: </b>A word that is used to connect words, phrases, clauses or sentences. e.g. and, but, or, etc.
            <br /><b>Interjection: </b>A word that expresses strong emotion or surprise. e.g. Wow!, Ouch!, etc.
