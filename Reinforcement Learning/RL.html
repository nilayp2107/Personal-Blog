            <li>Supervised Learning</li>
            <p>We have to find a function 'f' using x and y provided.</p>

            <p>Goal: Classification, Regression</p>
            <li>Unsupervised Learning</li>
            <p>We have to find a function 'f' only using the x provided.</p>
            <p>Dataset: Static Dataset</p>
            <p>Goal: Clustering</p>
            <li>Reinforcement Learning</li>
            <p>This is a totally different case. We are required to find 'f' using x and z provided. The 'f' will later be used to find y.</p>
            <p>Dataset: Data from Dynamic Environment</p>
            <p>Goal: Best sequence of actions for optimal outcome</p>

        <h1>What is Reinforcement Learning?</h1>
        <p>It is a part of Artificial Intelligence. In Reinforcement Learning, an <span class="key-word">agent</span> is put in an <span class="key-word">environment</span> and it learns to behave in that environment by performing certain <span class="key-word">actions</span> and observing the <span class="key-word">rewards</span> which it gets from those actions. </p>

        <h2>Process of Reinforcement Learning</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>The agent is able to observe the current state of the environment.</li>
            <li>From that observed state, it decides which actions to take.</li>
            <li>The Environment changes state and produces a reward for that action.</li>
            <li>The agent receives both the state and the reward.</li>
            <li>Using the information the agent determines whether the action was good and should be repeated, or if it was bad and should be avoided.</li>
            This obserbation-action-reward cycle continues until learning is complete.
        </ol>
        <h3>Agent</h3>
        <p>It is a piece of software that explores, interacts with and learn from the environment</p>
        <p>You can think yourself as the agent who is left on an abandoned island. After panicing for a while you will start exploring the environment, which is in our case the island. After exploring you will interact with the flora and fauna and finally learn about the plants and flowers, climate conditions and the dangers around.</p>
