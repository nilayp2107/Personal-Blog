        <h3>How is policy Structured?</h3>
        <p>In a Reinforcement Learning Algorithm, the neural network represents the policy. We cannot structure a policy without choosing the Reinforcement Learning algorithm.</p>
        <p>The three types of policy structures for Reinforcement Learning approaches are:</p>

            <li>Value function base</li>
