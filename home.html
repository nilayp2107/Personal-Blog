        <p>If you find yourself obsessing over someone, it's never a reflection of how good they are, but always the reflection of how bad your relationship has become with yourself.</p>
        <p>When you are truly in a space of self-love, no one can ever have that much power over you. So instead of putting your focus on why they aren't giving you attention, put it towards asking yourself why you're not giving yourself enough. </p>

        <p>Just remember, being lost is always part of the journey.</p>
