        <h1>Python</h1>
        <p>Python is a high-level programming language developed by Guido Van Rossum. 
            The name was kept after the English TV series "Monty Python's Flying Circus. It's is an <b>interpreted</b> language.<br />
            There are two main modes of Python Programming:<br />
            <ol>
                <li>Script Mode Programming (Notebook)</li>
                <li>Interactive Mode Programming (.py file)</li>
            </ol>
        </p>

        <h4>Identifiers</h4>
            Names given to identify variables, fuctions, class, module or any othe object.<br />
            You can't use the reserved keywords as identifiers. 
        <h4>Indentations</h4>
            All the statements within the block should be indented the same amount. 
            <br />Multiple statements can be written in a single line using semicolon (;).

        <h4>Data Types</h4>
            Python supports five data types:
            <ol>
                <li>Numbers</li>
                <li>Strings</li>
                <li>Lists</li>
                <li>Tuples</li>
                <li>Dictionaries</li>
            </ol>
        <h5>Numbers:</h3>
        <p>Python supports three kinds of number data types:
            <ol>
                <li>Integers (Signed)</li>
                <li>Float</li>
                <li>Complex</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <h5>Strings:</h3>
        <p>
            Contiguous set of characters represented in the quotation marks. We can use slice operator with indexes starting at 0 in the beginning of the string and working their way from -1 to the end.
            <b>+ sign</b> is the concatenation operator and <b>*</b> is the repetition operator.
        </p>
        <h5>Lists:</h5>
        <p>
            Lists contain items seperated by ',' and enclosed within square brackets []. Items in a list can be of different data types, unlike C++.
        </p>
        <h5>Tuples: </h5>
        <p>
            Tuples are similar to lists but they are enclosed within paranthesis (). The elements and size of the tuple can't be changed.
        </p>
        <h5>Dictionaries: </h5>
        <p>
            Dictionaries are enclosed within curly braces {}. It consists of key-value pairs. The key is unique and the value can be accessed by the key.
        </p>

        <h4>Operators</h4>
        <p>
            In the statement "4+5", the '+' operator manipulates the value of the operands which are 4 and 5 in this case. Python supports different types of Operators.
        </p>
        <h5>Arithmetic Operators:</h5>
        <p>
            The basic arithmetic operators are <b>addition, subtraction, division, multiplication, modulus, exponent</b> and <b>floor division(//).</b>
        </p>
        <h5>Comparison Operators:</h5>
        <p>
            These types of operators compare the values on both the sides and decide the relation between them. They are called relational operators.
        </p>
        <h5>Assignment Operators: </h5>
        <p>
            Assignment operator assigns the value on the right hand side to the variables on the left hand side.
            <br />The different assignment operators are <b>equal to, add and, subtract and, multiple and, divide and, modulus and,</b> and <b>exponential and</b>.
        </p>
        <h5>Logical and Membership Operators: </h5>
        <p>
            The Logical operators supported in python are logical <b>AND</b>, logical <b>OR</b>, and logical <b>NOT</b>.
            <br />The Membership operators are <b>in</b> and <b>not in</b> operators.
        </p>

        <h4>Python Decision Making</h4>
        <p>The basic decision making statements in python are as follows:
            <ul>
                <li><b>if statement</b></li>
                <li><b>If...else statement</b></li>
                <li><b>If...elif...else statement</b></li>
                <li><b>Nested if statement</b></li>
            </ul>
        </p>
