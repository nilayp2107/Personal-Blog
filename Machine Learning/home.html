        <h1>Machine Learning</h1>
        <p>The term Machine Learning was first used by <span class="key-word">Arthur Samuel</span> in the year 1959. 
            The first formal definition was given by <span class="key-word">Tom M. Mitchell</span>.
        </p>
        <p>The purpose of AI is to make computers learn from experience (no human intervention) and understand the world in terms of hierarchy of concepts. Thus the term AI <b>Deep Learning</b>.</p>
        <h2>Classic Machine Learning</h2>
        <h3>Model and Cost Function</h3>
        <p>Basically, machine learning is allowing computers to learn to do tasks without being programmed explicitly to do so.
            <br /> We will look at the mathematical representation of supervised learning problems by building the hypothesis function
            and cost function to caluculate the error.
            <br> In  supervised learning we need to build a relationship hypothesis between X and Y.

        <p>
            x<sup>[i]</sup> = Set of input variables   1 &le; i &le; m
            <br /> y<sup>[i]</sup> = Set of output variable  1 &le; i &le; m 
        </p>
        <h5>Training Set</h5>
        <p>The set x<sup>[i]</sup> and y<sup>[i]</sup> together are called training set and a single pair is called <b>training pair</b>.
            <br />X is {x<sup>[1]</sup>, x<sup>[2]</sup>,..., x<sup>[m]</sup>}
            <br />Y is {y<sup>[1]</sup>, y<sup>[2]</sup>,..., y<sup>[m]</sup>}
        </p>

        <h5>Cost Function</h5>
        <p>It calculates the average difference of all the results of hypothesis with the input from X and the actual outputs from Y.
            <br /><b>J(&theta;<sub>1</sub>,&theta;<sub>2</sub>) = 1/2m &sum;<sup>m</sup><sub>i=1</sub> (&ycirc;<sub>i</sub> - y<sub>i</sub>)<sup>2</sup></b>
