        <h1>Deep Learning</h1>
        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>IBM's DeepBlue machine defeated world chess champion Garry Kasparov in 1997. However, the chess world is rather small.</p>
        <p>Knowledge was first hard coded using formal language with logical inference rules. This was known as <b>knowledge based</b> approach.</p>
        <p>Then <b>Machine Learning</b> was developed to have the capacity to extract patterns from raw data, automating the need to actually hard code the knowledge base. 
            E.g. We could use <b>Logistic Regression</b> to determine whether we should use cesarean delivery or not, <b>naive Bayes</b> to classify mail as spam or not, etc.
        </p>
        <p>With this the <b>Representation</b> of data also hold a significance. The data which is used to train the model using Machine learning alogirthms have attributes called <b>features</b></p>
        <p>Finding proper representation of data is sometimes time consuming, so people came with the idea of using ML to find good set of features. This is known as <b>Representation Learning</b>. 
            <br />E.g. <b>Autoencoders</b> which consists of <b>encoders</b> and <b>decoders </b>are used to find good representation of data.    
        </p>
        <p><b>Factors of Variation</b> are the features which explains the data and influences the output.</p>
        <h2>Applications</h2>
        <p>The main motive for Deep Learning is to build systems which support humans by either supporting existing human capabilities or providing new capabilities.</p>

        <h3>Binary Classification Applications</h3>
        <p>The primary objective of binary classification is to distinguish the data into 2 classes. Following are the applications:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Spam Detection</li>
            <li>Resume Pre-Screening</li>
            <li>Cancer Diagnosis</li>
            <li>Cognitive Impairment Recognition by Apple App Usage</li>
            <li>Sentiment Analysis</li>
            <li>Food Quality Control</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Steps Involved in Building Deep Learning Models</h3>
        <p><b>Goal: </b> Design Models that generalise well to new, previously unseen data
            <br /><b>Step 1:</b> Split the data into a "training set" and a "test set"
            <br /><b>Step 2:</b> Train the model on "training set" to try to minimize prediction error on it.
            <br /><b>Step 3:</b> Apply the trained model on "test set" to measure the generalization error.
        </p>

        <h3>Evaluating Classification Models: Confusion Matrix</h3>
        <p>A confusion matrix or a contigency table or an error matrix consists of rows and columns with the predicted and actual numbers as shown.</p>
        <table style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
            <tr>
                <td></td>
                <td>Actual Positive</td>
                <td>Actual Negative</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Predicted Positive</td>
                <td style="border: 1px solid black;">TP</td>
                <td style="border: 1px solid black;">FP</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Predicted Negative</td>
                <td style="border: 1px solid black;">FN</td>
                <td style="border: 1px solid black;">TN</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <p>
            Where TP = True Positive, FP = False Positive, FN = False Negative, TN = True Negative
        </p>
        <h4>Accuracy = <sup>TP+TN</sup>&frasl;<sub>TP+FP+FN+TN</sub></h4>
        <h4>Precision = <sup>TP</sup>&frasl;<sub>TP+FP</sub></h4>
        <h4>Recall = <sup>TP</sup>&frasl;<sub>TP+FN</sub></h4>
        <h4>F1 Score = <sup>2*Precision*Recall</sup>&frasl;<sub>Precision+Recall</sub></h4>
        For email detection it's better to use Precision whereas in cancer detection it's better to use Recall.

        <h3>Biological neurons: Inspiration</h3>
        <p>
            The main inspiration came from the animal's computing machinery. 
            <br /><b>Neuron: </b> The basic unit in the nervous system for receiving, processing and transmitting information. e.g. messages such as "hot", "loud", "spicy".
            <br />A nematode has 302 neurons, whereas a human has around 100 billion neurons.       
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>When the input signals exceed a certain threshold within a short period of time, a neuron <b>"fires"</b></li>
            <li>Neuron <b>"firing"</b> is an <b>"all-or-none"</b> process where either a signal is sent or nothing happens.</li>
        </ul>
