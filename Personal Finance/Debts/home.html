        <h1>Let's talk about Debt</h1>
        <h3>Budgeting</h3>
        <p>It means keeping the expenses lower than the total income of the household.
            <br />i.e. <b>expenses &le; income</b>
        </p>
        <p>
            <br />However, the problem arises in making an efficient financial plan when the expense are greater than the income. 
            <br />In such cases, the person resorts to borrow money. Borrowing once or twice is normal, but when it becomes a regular thing than it can put the person in serious debt problem.
            <br />In such scenarios it's difficut to save money. A person who has assests but isn't liquid can use the savings to get cash.
            <br />There are laws that states that a person can't be forced to render service in lieu of payment of debt. This is known as <b>Undue servitude</b>.
            <br />In such cases, the person can pay through skills, if he/she is talented in his craft, like painting, writing, etc. and opts to pay for his/her debt by creating a painting or writing a book as per the creditor.
            <br />When a person dies, the law has provuded for a hierarchy of preferences in the payment of such debts.

            Debt is really a simple concept which provides that a person who borrowed something from another is bound to pay that debt.
            <br />More often, the interest rates due for a certain debt is even higher than the principal amount borrowed.
            <br /><b>Secured Loan</b> means the debtor borrowed some money and supported the loan by collateral like plot, house, car or any other asset or a security for the loan.
            <br />Most creditors require a security before granting a loan because it gives them something to hold on to or forfeit in case the debtor defaults in payment.
            <br />When the debtor fails to pay his loans, the creditor can still run after him by filing a case in court. 
            <br />Being in debt is common even for the rich and the famous, the only difference between them and the common people is that their debts can be in millions since they have more assets to support their loans.
